#Decker

A Chrome extension that pretties up Twitter.

- Widens the content area, removes right and left columns, including things like “Trends” and “Who to follow”.
- Resolves (i.e. removes) t.co links for twitter.com, so not redirects.
- Hides Moments

This is for me! Feel free to use it but caveat emptor.

##To use
